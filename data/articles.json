Especially exciting about 611 is that (according to King County records), it was built in 1907, making it one of Seattle's very early modern buildings, and in step with goings on in other major cities.</p>\n<hr class=\"CONTENT_PAGE_BREAK\" />\n<p class=\"MEDIA_ATTACHMENTS_BOX inlineContent\" id=\"MEDIA_ATTACHMENTS_BOX\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"COPY relatedContentBox RELATED_CONTENT_BOX inlineContent\" id=\"RELATED_CONTENT_BOX\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Early modernists designers were not gripped by the fear of using brick, as were many later practitioners. With an emphasis on the new, the factory assembled, and the lightweight, early moderns had many reasons to eschew brick: it was traditional, it was heavy (relative to newer materials such as steel and aluminum), and its appearance was fully embraced by society. &nbsp;Brick was hardly capable of eliciting the wonder and novelty of the new that many of the then avant-garde architects craved. &nbsp;Though I have some sympathies with their reasoning, omitting such a useful material on ideological grounds is not compelling enough to overshadow its many positive attributes, including those of economy, durability, and scale. Looking back far enough, say to the first quarter of the 20th Century, one finds that brick did make an occasional appearance in modernist design, proving that the goals of cubic mass, simple form, and restraint of ornament were still possible in these brick clad anomalies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These outliers may have come to be because the newer materials architects really wanted to use were not yet readily available nor understood by builders. Mies, the main harbinger of glass and steel, frequently used brick prior to the 1930s, but even such examples are rare (Frank Lloyd Wright is a notable exception). Below is the Lange House, one of Mies&rsquo;s brick houses, built in 1930. While the brick could have easily been covered in stucco &mdash; making it more abstract and purer of form &mdash; to my eye the brick takes little away from the cubic massing and clean lines. The cleanly detailed brick, along with expansive ribbon windows and an aggressively cantilevered entry canopy leave little room for debate that this is a modernist building. Nevertheless, such well executed buildings did not propagate a confidence that brick was suitable in achieving a modernist aesthetic, its qualities being overlooked in favor of more contemporary and non-traditional materials.</p>\n<p class=\"floatCenter inlineImageFrame inlineImage\" style=\"height: 310px; width: 379px;\"><a href=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2011/10/15/chs-schemata-/haus_lange_612.jpg/thumbnail\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/media/news/2011/10/15/jfSi3VpPoZXigxzeS2Z442Ukln4.jpg\" width=\"379\" /></a><span class=\"inlineImageCaption inlineImageCaption\"><span id=\"CONTENT_MEDIA_DESCRIPTION\">Lange House (source <a href=\"http://www.miessociety.org\">www.miessociety.org</a>)</span></span></p>\n<p>While it may be a bit of a push to make much out of cubic massing in such a small building (there is little room to do anything else but), 611 Malden's squareness of presentation nevertheless toes the party line of early modernism, and is punctuated by the squat box that forms the entry vestibule. The building&rsquo;s dual heritage of early modernism and deco is further revealed at the vestibule, where a gently curving, shiny aluminum (or painted to look aluminum) canopy furthers the deco association. Other delightful touches at the vestibule include bricks forming another curve, leading to a deco inspired door surrounded by glass block (one of modernism&rsquo;s most misused materials, but used quite well here). Although lacking the horizontality that the windows that the Lange House displays, those on 611 have a pleasing horizontal proportion to them (kudos to the building&rsquo;s owner for keeping them intact).</p>\n<p>Flanking the entry stair are a pair of garages that are as well-integrated into a project as you will see on the Hill, and whose function in the project exceeds the mere utility of parking cars by not only framing the entry steps but also by extending the useful &nbsp;size of the front lawn. Also done in brick, the garage masses give the small building a greater heft. The pipe rails, lacking the inner rails required by current codes, are a nice foil to the garages&rsquo; mass, and would do Mies proud. While strong in their attitude to the street, the garages fit in perfectly with the overall &nbsp;building-landscape approach, stepping down to the sidewalk in a flowing transition of building, turf, garage, and sidewalk.</p>\n<p class=\"floatCenter inlineImageFrame inlineImage\" style=\"height: 536px; width: 590px;\"><a href=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2011/10/15/chs-schemata-/611-malden-lane-alternate.jpg/large\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/media/news/2011/10/15/QSa4McgHKLCz30zkLkgrXUvE6I-large.jpg\" width=\"590\" /></a><span class=\"inlineImageCaption inlineImageCaption\"><span id=\"CONTENT_MEDIA_DESCRIPTION\">(Images: John Feit/Schemata Workshop/CHS)</span></span></p>\n<p>Not all is serious at 611, yet all has its place. The north and south elevations are a bit more relaxed than the rigors of the front, where the mass of brick is pushed out midsection by another gently curving wall, this time on both floors. Not on the front, mind you, where it would be more &lsquo;expressive&rsquo;, but on the sides, and partially hidden from the street. Perhaps the curved walls ended up on the sides because the interior space dictated their placement, where they may have the greatest benefit to those inside the building; certainly a more important consideration than to those passing by on Malden. Perhaps the architect of this modest yet excellent little building had the confidence and conviction of a seasoned hand, knowing that a little lapse in the rigor of the box &mdash; especially if veiled from one&rsquo;s glance &mdash; would not detract from the nobility of the whole, and felt compelled to be discrete by keeping the curved walls on the side elevations, maintaining the modest street frontage. Perhaps this same perceived modesty kept the architect from making the curved wall out of another material, even another pattern of brick? If my speculations ring true, 611 presents a lesson in modesty from which most of my architect-colleagues would benefit.</p>\n<p><a class=\"floatCenter inlineImage\" href=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2011/10/15/chs-schemata-/611-malden-lane-detail.jpg/large\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/media/news/2011/10/15/lgwWebfBV2p9B49hsVXSRLHzvU-large.jpg\" width=\"512\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><a class=\"floatLeft inlineImage\" href=\"http://www.schemataworkshop.com/blog\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/media/news/2011/4/3/dMccSdsPkxh54BPrPKQUJeXA.jpg\" width=\"130\" /></a></em></p>\n<p><em>John Feit is an architect on Capitol Hill, and works at <strong><a href=\"http://www.schemataworkshop.com/blog\">Schemata Workshop</a></strong>.

The group then marched on to Broadway and continued to chant and wave signs as they passed restaurant goers and nightlife seekers. A contingent of three to four SPD cruisers accompanied the march on its tour to make sure the group stayed on the sidewalks and, we presume, to ensure that <a href=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2011/04/21/more-shattered-glass-broadway-chase-bank-suffers-most-significant-damage-yet\">nothing like this went down</a> even though bandana-covered faces were rare in this crowd and CHS didn't witness a single act of violence during the procession.

He also says he can still laugh at what has happened to him over the past week. And, yes, he's considering legal action for defamation of character. But mostly he just wants an apology and some consequences for <strong>Victoria Liss</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"She kind of picked a lucky guy,\" <strong>Andrew Meyer\u00a0</strong>told CHS by phone Friday afternoon. \"I still laugh at it from day to day. I'm not the kind of guy to go after somebody unless they deserve it.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Laughs or no, the situation is plenty serious for Meyer. He tells CHS he has sought legal counsel but isn't sure where he'll go with it at this point. For him, it's important to protect the reputation he's earned in his profession. In Texas, Meyer is currently working in the private club industry, he said.</p>\n<p>\"I've been in the restaurant industry all my life,\" Meyer said. \"For anything like this to come out is a striking blow.\"</p>\n<p>Bimbos/Cha Cha has declined to comment on the incident and Liss. Bimbos, by the way, is a CHS advertiser. And the other Andrew Meyer -- the real(?) Andrew Meyer who allegedly left the zero tip and the nasty note -- nobody has yet heard from him.</p>\n<p>But this Meyer -- the other Andrew Meyer -- he tells CHS he found out about the unfolding situation in a series of Saturday night texts from people in Seattle he used to manage at the <strong>Cheesecake Factory</strong> before he moved three years ago. \"At first I brushed it off,\" Meyer said. By Sunday, it was all over the news.</p>\n<p>Meyer said he has been able to laugh off the situation despite the torrent of hate mail and ugly messages that ended up directed at him, his wife Jennifer and even his mother.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"I got 68 hate messages in my inbox,\" Meyer said. \"But only 3 apologies. It's a whole lot easier to say something mean when you can just type it, I guess.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">CHS connected with the couple when Meyer's wife Jennifer sent us this mail about the impact the situation has had on their lives:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To Whom It May Concern:<br />I just finished reading your article - <a href=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2011/10/13/another-andrew-meyer-apology\">Another Andrew Meyer apology</a> - and would like to make a response.\u00a0I am absolutely sickened by the amount of press coverage Victoria Liss is receiving from the media regarding the public social media crusade she started against my husband, Andrew \"Andy\" Meyer. Andrew Meyer is a common name and I am not certain the number of different Andrew Meyer's she \"attacked\" before claiming my husband was THE customer who stiffed her from a tip and made a degrading comment about her weight. However, she decided to post my husband's picture which, in turn, led to others \"digging up\" information on him...some going as far to find his photo and college information from the Texas Tech Phi Kappa Psi website.</p>\n<p>\u00a0I would like to clarify for the record that she has not personally apologized to Andy regarding the situation she created. She has apologized through those who write the articles about this situation and to those who read her facebook wall. My husband received disturbing messages, some as far as threatening to kill him, for days. And I received countless messages harassing me about marrying a \"national joke\".</p>\n<p>\u00a0The mistake was discovered after my husband contacted Cha Cha Lounge to let them know that we had moved from Seattle to Dallas three years ago and have not been to visit since. They responded that they would take down the post but could not control those who had already re-posted his picture. Fortunately, they came out several hours later with an apology (both personally and publicly). It's unfortunate that an individual and business would react to a negative situation through the use of social media to bully/harass another individual rather than respond in an appropriate manner.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0What does this say to our children who are bullied/harassed on a daily basis by their peers in school? Often times the end result is catastrophic - alcohol/drugs, dropouts, suicide, etc. It is my hope that all parties involved - Victoria, Cha Cha Seattle, and news sources - really use this opportunity to reflect on the consequences of how they attempted to resolve this particular manner and, in the future, THINK before they start a campaign to victimize somebody else.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Sincerely,<br />Jennifer Meyer</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meyer said he is not sure where he'll go with the attention the situation has garnered. He has been called by a few television producers but he's been taking his time sorting out the options and letting things settle out after a manic few days.

Twiddling the knobs, so to speak, of an important part of the Hill. This week we talk with <strong>Neumos</strong>\u00a0sound crew members\u00a0<strong>Josh Penner\u00a0</strong>and\u00a0<strong>Alice Wilder</strong>, two diligent soldiers of audio who, unlike the rock stars they work with, are rarely in the spotlight. These engineers provide a vital component of what makes a Capitol Hill show great. Here\u2019s their take on what they see (and hear) from the back of the club and what it\u2019s like to work the boards at one of Capitol Hill\u2019s premier music venues.\u00a0</p><p><strong>CHS:</strong> Introduction roll call: what\u2019s your job title, how long have you worked at Neumos, and how\u2019d you get the job?</p><p><strong>Josh Penner:</strong> I have been working at Neumos as lead audio tech for about six months. Rachel [Willner, production manager] and I have been working together going on nine years. She was my boss at <strong>Graceland/El Corazon</strong>. We also worked together when I would come through town on tour. We work well together and she felt confident in my ability to be a systems tech, to organize the venue, and to run a tight ship.</p><p><strong>Alice Wilder</strong>: Audio engineer. I got the job by interning at Neumos for about six months beginning in the summer of 2007. I've been there ever since.</p><p><strong>CHS:</strong> Have either of you worked at other venues here in the city, or elsewhere? What do you like about working at Neumos?</p><p><strong>JP:</strong> I still currently work at El Corazon and the <strong>Showbox</strong>, as well as tour. I really enjoy working at Neumos because of how well the venue is run. We have a great production staff: Rachel and Kate; audio: Alice, Evan, Kirsten, Ian, Robin; security, etc. Everyone really takes pride in what they are doing. We really like to make Neumos \"our home.\" Also the PA system sounds awesome. We get a lot of good toys to play with.</p><p><strong>AW:</strong><strong>Chop Suey</strong> and the Showbox. I like Neumos because it's super dog friendly, which is amazing, the staff is pretty sweet and professional, and I generally like the genres of music that come through.</p><div style=\"text-align: left; padding: 3px;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/slightlynorth/5420239390/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5174/5420239390_cedd86e881.jpg\" /></a><br /><span><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/slightlynorth/5420239390/\">2011.035</a>, originally uploaded by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/slightlynorth/\">Slightlynorth</a>.</span></div><p><strong>CHS:</strong> How does the room at Neumos stack up next to other Seattle venues in terms of sound?</p><p><strong>AW:</strong> The PA is fantastic: sounds good with a flat EQ [equalizer], which is rare. Very easy to wrangle in.\u00a0</p><p><strong>JP:</strong> We have a great PA system. I have been all over the world touring and I have to say Seattle has some of the best sounding rooms and PAs, but it really comes down to the room. You can put a million dollar sound system in a shitty room and it\u2019s still gonna sound like garbage. We have a great acoustic environment, high ceilings, and balcony. There\u2019s \u00a0not a lot of places for the sound to bounce around in the room. Plus I always loved standing on the balcony and seeing the side of stage. It makes you feel that much closer to the band, getting to watch every move.</p><p><strong>CHS:</strong> Where did you pick up the trade and what interests you about sound engineering?</p><p><strong>JP:</strong> My dad bought me a 4-track recorder for my birthday one year and I started recording my own bands in middle school and high school. When CD burners first came out I was using a recording software to edit and put my stuff on to CD. When it came to college I already knew that recording was what I wanted to do. During my 2nd year of college I started Interning at <strong>Studio 7</strong> and after a year I was working shifts and doing live sound full-time. That was a very exciting point in my life--I got to quit my day job and make a living doing what I love. What interests me about sound engineering is it\u2019s all about variables and creativity. So many factors make things sound good or bad. Doing sound is a process of \"cleaning up,\u201d of taking things out of the mix to make an instrument \"stick out.\u201d It\u2019s very satisfying to take a bunch of instruments, put them in their individual places in a mix, and listen to the end result.\u00a0</p><p><strong>AW:</strong> I've been interested in sound since high school. Nothing else, job wise, seems as fun, especially not accounting, which was my major in college--fun fact!</p><p><strong>CHS:</strong> How about a band that made your life hell and why?</p><p><strong>AW:</strong> [Capitol Hill group who at one point were banned from six Capitol Hill clubs] <strong>Mad Rad</strong>. I'm guessing I wouldn't have to go into too much detail on that one. Not to mention the fact that they would probably be into it if they read this.\u00a0</p><p><strong>JP:</strong><strong>Danzig</strong> loves to throw his microphone at the monitor engineer.</p><p><strong>CHS:</strong> And one that made your job easy?</p><p><strong>JP:</strong> Any band or crew that is pro and that walks in at the beginning of the day with a smile on their face. People forget that it is a privilege to make a living doing what we do whether it is a stage tech or a song writer. We are all in this game for the same reason, so let\u2019s make this about the music not your ego. Every band should have to read \"Get In The Van\" by Henry Rollins before they play their first gig.</p><p><strong>AW:</strong><strong>The Handsome Furs</strong>. They are nicest, coolest people I've ever met.\u00a0</p><p><strong>CHS:</strong> Favorite Capitol Hill/Seattle bands to work with?</p><p><strong>JP:</strong> Hmm, well I got my start in the touring world working for [Seattle metal band] Himsa. I really like [Seattle hardcore group] <strong>Black Breath</strong>. I\u2019ve got to mix <strong>He Whose Ox is Gored</strong> a few times and that has always been a great time. I will be mixing [Seattle \u201cPsychodelick\u201d group] <strong>Master Musicians of Bukkake</strong> in a week or so and that is pretty rad.\u00a0</p><p><strong>AW:</strong> I'm gonna play the \"safe\" card here and say too many to name! But I'm also not afraid to cheese out and say that I do have a special thang for Grand Archives.</p><p><strong>CHS:</strong><strong>Doug Krebs</strong>, the sound engineer at the <strong>Tractor</strong>, recently alleged he\u2019d been \u201cviolently attacked\u201d by the frontman for Seattle <strong>Sub Pop</strong> band <strong>The Head and the Heart</strong>, claiming the attack was \u201cwithout any provocation and specifically directed at sound technicians.\u201d Ever been hassled by aggressive and/or drunk bands and if so, how did you deal with it?</p><p><strong>JP:</strong> I read an article about it. There are always two sides to any story. I\u2019m not going to make any opinions until I know more about the situation. I have dealt with aggressive bands, tour managers, promoters, etc. It comes with the territory. You gotta have thick skin in this industry. Shit will come at you left and right and if you get too hot headed that can bite you in the ass, same with being a pushover. You just got to have the right attitude. Know and act like you know what you are doing, but don't be cocky. I\u2019ve had a few cases where things turned physical but that is quite rare. People tend to leave me alone, I guess it helps that I\u2019m 6'4\" and have a bunch of tattoos. Ha!</p><p><strong>AW:</strong> I think the THATH thing is very unfortunate. I don't really know the whole story, or what led up to it, but seems pretty uncalled for, no matter how much stress you may be under. I feel for the sound guy. I've never really had a problem that crazy before. Crossing fingers!</p><p><strong>CHS:</strong> What are three things bands could do to make your job easier?</p><p><strong>JP:</strong> Show up on time! Nothing worse than having to dial in a mix while your production manager is breathing down the back of your neck asking when we will be ready to open doors because it\u2019s five minutes after doors and the opening band showed up 30 minutes ago. Pay attention. I can\u2019t tell you how many minutes are lost everyday while I check an instrument and let\u2019s say the guitar player just looks down at his instrument and plays an entire song before he/she realizes that we are ready to move on to the next instrument. Be nice. Same goes to sound guys. Nothing makes or ruins a band or sound guys day then that first impression at load in. If you come in all demanding acting like an a-hole then the sound guy is gonna be grumpy and not want to help you out as much. Same goes to sound engineers. It\u2019s amazing what a smile, handshake, and a few jokes will do to the day\u2019s morale.</p><p><strong>AW:</strong> Load in on time. Leave the stage while I'm pinning things down (it's really hard to mic a kick drum while drummer is pounding the shit out of it). Good, positive attitudes are kind of big deal and can be quite refreshing.</p><p><strong>CHS:</strong> Are there any misconceptions you feel the public/show goers have about sound guys?</p><p><strong>JP:</strong> That sound guys are all lazy stoners or drunks. Since we are on stage working, we work for the band and can get signatures for you. Or get you back stage. Mainly people think our job is all fun and games, that we are included in the party that is a rock concert. We get to work hours and hours before the show even starts and are there hours and hours after it is over.Granted I got into this line of work because it is fun and I make a living doing something I would do in my spare time. But we have a lot of responsibilities too and you can\u2019t have a successful/ professional show when you are drinking and partying. \u00a0</p><p><strong>AW:</strong> Yes, it's really hard to make a band sound like their professionally recorded and mastered studio album live. It's a completely different, way more dynamic world.</p><p><strong>CHS:</strong> Is Capitol Hill a good/fun place to work as a sound tech--why or why not?</p><p><strong>AW:</strong> Yes. It's awesome. The only thing that\u2019s kind of weird is that it's commonly either the first or last stop on U.S. tours, so the crew either really has it together or really doesn't. It's nice when it's the first one.</p><p><strong>JP:</strong> It\u2019s great! We get a lot of the up-and-coming bands that are starting to grow in popularity and as bands, but are not at super stardom yet. We get to watch bands \"grow up.\"</p><div style=\"text-align: left; padding: 3px;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamsayswhatt/4685561405/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4068/4685561405_8c96d036a3.jpg\" /></a><br /><span><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamsayswhatt/4685561405/\">Untitled</a>, originally uploaded by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamsayswhatt/\">adamsayswhatt</a>.</span></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/M8g8bbQ9Fx23m1Calfhg0ul9ywM/0/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/M8g8bbQ9Fx23m1Calfhg0ul9ywM/0/di\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/M8g8bbQ9Fx23m1Calfhg0ul9ywM/1/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/M8g8bbQ9Fx23m1Calfhg0ul9ywM/1/di\" /></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?a=PS6DiVxOw70:Lthpj4hMhUA:0OFmNJGTgU0\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?i=PS6DiVxOw70:Lthpj4hMhUA:0OFmNJGTgU0\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?a=PS6DiVxOw70:Lthpj4hMhUA:Bwv2rblVZ0k\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?i=PS6DiVxOw70:Lthpj4hMhUA:Bwv2rblVZ0k\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?a=PS6DiVxOw70:Lthpj4hMhUA:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?i=PS6DiVxOw70:Lthpj4hMhUA:D7DqB2pKExk\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?a=PS6DiVxOw70:Lthpj4hMhUA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?a=PS6DiVxOw70:Lthpj4hMhUA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?a=PS6DiVxOw70:Lthpj4hMhUA:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" /></a>\n</div><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Capitolhillseattle/~4/PS6DiVxOw70\" width=\"1\" />"

In two of the most impressive units, huge original stained glass panes provided the only source of natural light. But in a sign of what is now being done to further overhaul the building and improve its prospects for sales following <a href=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2011/07/12/capitol-hills-troubled-and-amazing-sanctuary-development-makes-a-comeback\">a transfer of ownership of the troubled project this summer</a>, a new solution is being put in place to solve the building's \"window problem\" and make a few other tweaks to accompany planned \"up to 40%\" price cuts when the units return to the market later this year.</p>\n<hr class=\"CONTENT_PAGE_BREAK\" />\n<p class=\"p1\">\"Obviously, we want to make sure it's the most appealing project,\" <strong>Chris Rossman</strong> of <strong>Sotheby's International Realty</strong> tells CHS. \"A benefit of already being on the market, we know what some of the objections were.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<p class=\"floatRight inlineImageFrame inlineImage\" style=\"width: 333px; height: 470px;\"><a href=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2011/10/13/sanctuary/gpky2qjvm0qz90ss45vieguksxg.jpg/large\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/media/news/2011/10/14/ddJUN6kPyOTTwVXFqGbvdKmx9zA-large.jpg\" width=\"333\" /></a><span class=\"inlineImageCaption inlineImageCaption\"><span id=\"CONTENT_MEDIA_DESCRIPTION\">The atrium. It's more amazing than this shows. Really. (Image: CHS)</span></span></p>\nRossman's words are a positive turn on the development's past failures in the marketplace as potential buyers rejected $1.5 million price tags and the project's near-religious devotion to preserving nearly all aspects of the former church -- including windows that you can't see through.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Rossman said the window solution is relatively simple -- but required permission from the city's landmark board because of the building's official historical status. Contractors are working to create tracked frames for the stained glass panes that will allow a resident to slide the glass sheets apart to look out a new clear pane of glass added to the old church's window frames.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other changes in the building include tricking out the appliance package in all units. A more ambitious work item is a redesign of the amazing shared atrium space in the middle of the building. We'll have more details on the redesign helmed by Seattle designer <strong>Robin Chell</strong>. Expect to hear about more promotional events in the incredible space as the building's sales process kicks back into gear.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You can learn more at <a href=\"http://www.liveatsanctuary.com/\">liveatsanctuary.com</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/exwg9tAr3_26fhS9A533FLg1MrQ/0/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/exwg9tAr3_26fhS9A533FLg1MrQ/0/di\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/exwg9tAr3_26fhS9A533FLg1MrQ/1/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/exwg9tAr3_26fhS9A533FLg1MrQ/1/di\" /></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?a=1wVjpXB6BgM:T_YTdUUySY0:0OFmNJGTgU0\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?i=1wVjpXB6BgM:T_YTdUUySY0:0OFmNJGTgU0\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?a=1wVjpXB6BgM:T_YTdUUySY0:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?i=1wVjpXB6BgM:T_YTdUUySY0:D7DqB2pKExk\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?a=1wVjpXB6BgM:T_YTdUUySY0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?a=1wVjpXB6BgM:T_YTdUUySY0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?a=1wVjpXB6BgM:T_YTdUUySY0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" /></a>\n</div><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Capitolhillseattle/~4/1wVjpXB6BgM\" width=\"1\" />"

The server provided this story to us, which my site posted. A photograph obtained from another on-line source bearing your image was applied to the Andrew Meyer who was involved in the incident and posted on my blog.</p>\n<p>After a short time, some of the blogs and eventually, the server herself, revealed that the Andrew in the photo was not the Andrew involved in the incident.</p>\n<hr class=\"CONTENT_PAGE_BREAK\" />\n<p>As the person co-ordinating this site and responsible for posting the story and photo, I want to express my deepest and sincere apologies to you for this error. I also wish to apologize for the many derisive and attacking comments you were made to endure on this blog-site as a result of my posting this. I also apologize to the fans of this blog-site for the controversy that was stirred up by this erroneous posting.</p>\n<p>CHS promises to ensure that in the future, further such stories will be fully investigated and be accurate before they get posted.\u00a0Again Andrew, my deepest apologies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Signed,<br />Justin</p>\n<p>Comment by cometregular</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Brutal.</p>\n<p>I spoke to Cometregular by phone (long story) and it turns out he really is a Pike/Pine old-timer (some of you might have hung out at a local watering hole he used to manage) and knows the <strong>Bimbos/Cha Cha</strong> bartender <strong>Victoria Liss</strong> who found herself at the center of the social media storm this week.</p>\n<p>There is nothing more painful to me than trying to explain \"the point\" of our posts. I did my best with Comet but also did not want to explain the situation away. If you're pissed at us, you're pissed. But our point was that <a href=\"http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2011/10/10/10297240-your-name-is-andrew-you-live-in-kent-you-work-at-microsoft-you-were-in-a-frat-and-on-friday-night-you-stiffed-a-popular-capitol-hill-barte\">public shaming</a> -- oops, <a href=\"http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2011/10/10/your-name-is-andrew-and-on-friday-night-you-stiffed-a-popular-capitol-hill-bartender\">URL changed</a> -- and \"banning\" somebody from Capitol Hill over the situation was ridiculous. As ridiculous <a href=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2011/10/10/banned-from-chs\">as banning -- and then un-banning --</a> a human being from a web site:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Banned from CHS -- UPDATE: Un-banned</strong><br />UPDATE x2: After consulting CHS comments, we have decided that a 12-hour ban is sufficient. Andrew, you are welcome to again read the site. Enjoy capitolhillseattle.com</p>\n<p>UPDATE: Due to the back and forth over whether the Andrew pictured was actually the Andrew involved, we are removing the photo. Andrew, however, remains banned. Naughty Andrew.</p>\n<p>We're sorry, Andrew, but we're going to have to ask you to leave. The community demands it. Try again\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/capitolhillseattleblog/posts/282501541769245\">when this all blows over</a>, maybe.</p>\n<p>Also, Bimbos is a CHS advertiser.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Use of the <strong>Andrew Meyer</strong> picture linked to by Liss angered Comet and plenty of others. He saw a situation getting out of hand, quickly, for a friend. We removed the picture from the post immediately as the story changed. But the story had already <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2048367/Bimbos-waitress-Victoria-Liss-launches-hunt-tipper-Andrew-Meyer.html\">spread</a>.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the issues over \"the wrong Andrew Meyer\" have overshadowed<a href=\"http://lineout.thestranger.com/lineout/archives/2011/10/10/victoria-liss-vs-the-receipt-creep-capitol-hill-debacle\"> the original incident </a>and other questions raised by the situation. Here's how CHS reader Andrew -- another Andrew -- put it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I've lived on the hill for for 3 years now and particularly over the past ~6 months there's been really drastic changes to the type of people that visit the hill. it used to be the occasional weekend would have the douchebag bridge and tunnel types, leaving the rest of the week to hill regulars. lately though it doesn't seem that there is a single night that I can go out and just enjoy the hill and old friends. in addition to the crowds, I've been involved in a number of fights and altercations; I've feel like as a result of this influx of bar tourism there's also been a much higher number of crimes being committed.</p>\n<p>any thoughts on this? I think it would really be interesting to see if this trend is tangible, and perhaps track down what the driving forces are for why these people invade the hill. almost every street argument I've been a part of has been with some drunk guy in a button down looking to pick a fight with some hipster kid. why come to the hill at all if that's your attitude?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's a possible undercurrent. <a href=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2011/10/10/police-respond-to-weekend-bar-brawls-on-capitol-hill\">This bar brawl</a> we reported earlier this week and <a href=\"http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2011/10/13/karaoke-melee\">fleshed out by the Stranger today</a> provides an adequate anecdote.

You can tell them she was, she lived on Capitol Hill, she opened her second ice cream shop -- ever -- here, and in 2011, <strong>Molly Moon Neitzl's</strong> mini chain of ice cream shops won the top slot in the first ever King County Small Business Awards.</p>\n<p>OK. You might leave that last part out. But it's true.</p>\n<p><strong>Molly Moon's </strong>got the nod over a Renton fiber optic supplier and Seattle's <strong>Trophy Cupcakes</strong> in the awards to recognize the most successful small business entrepreneurs in King County announced Wednesday.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nominations were made by local jurisdictions and business organizations from July through September, and the 125 King County businesses that were nominated were narrowed down to three finalists in each category before today&rsquo;s awards ceremony. Businesses had to have 50 employees or less and have been in business for at least three years to qualify for the seven award categories.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Molly Moon's is not a Capitol Hill native as the first shop, you can also tell your great grandkids, was in Wallingford. What is Wallingford, they will ask. Moon's expanded to Capitol Hill and <a href=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2009/04/25/pine-streets-big-day-ice-cream-hippies-you\">opened its Oddfellows building shop</a> in April that year. Other frozen treats <a href=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2009/06/02/old-school-is-now-in-session\">followed</a>. And now some of <a href=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2009/07/09/bluebird-homemade-ice-cream-and-tea-parlor-opens-today\">those ventures </a>are also <a href=\"http://www.phinneywood.com/2011/10/10/bluebird-microcreamery-opening-phinney-ice-cream-shop-on-friday/\">expanding </a>-- Congratulations, <strong>Bluebird</strong>. Molly Moon's now operates five locations in Seattle.</p>\n<p>While Neitzl is the face of her business, Molly Moon's also has deeper Capitol Hill roots as the neighborhood's nightlife entrepreneur <strong>Marcus Lalario</strong> backed the ice cream venture's expansion as an investor. Like Lalario, Netizl has been active forging political connections and embracing initiatives like <a href=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2011/05/06/molly-moons-leads-the-way-in-offering-paid-sick-days-to-employees\">paid sick leave</a>.</p>\n<p>Capitol Hill design firm&nbsp;<strong>Schemata Workshop</strong> was nominated for Workforce Development business of the year but didn't win. <a href=\"http://www.schemataworkshop.com/\">The 12th ave workshop</a> is the workplace of <strong>John Feit</strong>, writer behind<a href=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/members/details/John_Feit_Schemata_Workshop\"> the CHS Schemata posts</a>, and, of course, is responsible for <a href=\"http://www.schemataworkshop.com/portfolio/\">some very cool projects</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"floatRight inlineImageFrame inlineImage\" style=\"width: 333px;

When fire arrived, the man was being held about six feet above the ground by the machine. The emergency workers were able to maneuver the man's body out of the machinery and remove him from the pit. He suffered head trauma and damage to his legs -- the extent of his injuries is being assessed at Harborview.<br /><br />5:39PM - SFD has posted a <a href=\"http://fireline.seattle.gov/2011/10/12/technical-rescue-crew-rescues-construction-worker/\">report</a> on the incident:<br /><blockquote><br />Around 1:30 p.m. dispatchers received a 9-1-1 call about the male in his 20\u2019s trapped in a pit at the 700 block of Marion Street. When firefighters arrived, they found the man dangling 6 feet off the ground and stuck between a concrete shoring wall and a large drilling apparatus. The man was conscious and alert and talking.<br /><br />Construction crews say the drilling apparatus chain broke causing the apparatus to lurch forward trapping the worker between the machine and the wall of under-construction parking garage.<br /><br />The construction worker was freed by maneuvering his body around the steel equipment. The worker suffered head trauma and injuries to his ankle and leg. Medics transported the patient to Harborview Medical Center.</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/LUVsTdWEHyTyUOkX0b1X8_GOcs8/0/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/LUVsTdWEHyTyUOkX0b1X8_GOcs8/0/di\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/LUVsTdWEHyTyUOkX0b1X8_GOcs8/1/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/LUVsTdWEHyTyUOkX0b1X8_GOcs8/1/di\" /></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?a=gZ_8ztuvWwQ:mlc86Mn5Fpk:0OFmNJGTgU0\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?i=gZ_8ztuvWwQ:mlc86Mn5Fpk:0OFmNJGTgU0\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?a=gZ_8ztuvWwQ:mlc86Mn5Fpk:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?i=gZ_8ztuvWwQ:mlc86Mn5Fpk:D7DqB2pKExk\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?a=gZ_8ztuvWwQ:mlc86Mn5Fpk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?a=gZ_8ztuvWwQ:mlc86Mn5Fpk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?a=gZ_8ztuvWwQ:mlc86Mn5Fpk:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Capitolhillseattle?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" /></a>\n</div><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Capitolhillseattle/~4/gZ_8ztuvWwQ\" width=\"1\" />"

There's talk of expanding the Capitol Hill Riviera.</p>\n<p>The cruise down the Hill to Madison Park Beach is, along with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dykiki/202137973157233\">Dykiki</a>, well known to Capitol Hill masses looking to chill on the shores of Lake Washington. Now the Seattle Parks Board is considering a proposal to open up the shoreline on park land just north of the popular beach -- a public hearing is scheduled for early November.</p>\n<p>The Madison Park Blogger says the neighborhood, in a theme that seems to define Seattle living as the city's population grows and density increases, is torn:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While we may really be the elitist, keep-it-all-to-ourselves kind of neighborhood that our detractors claim we are, I&rsquo;d like to think we&rsquo;re better than that.</p>\n<hr class=\"CONTENT_PAGE_BREAK\" />\n<p>The choice before us, I believe, is this: &nbsp;Do we as a community wish we were more like our exclusive enclave, Broadmoor, with its perimeter walls and gate guards? Or are we a neighborhood that believes in sharing with other Seattleites the very amenities that help make this&nbsp;<em>Village by the Lake</em>&nbsp;a joy for those of us lucky enough to live here?&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><br /><small><a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=e+lynn+at+43rd+ave+seattle+wa&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=E+Lynn+St+%26+43rd+Ave+E,+Seattle,+King,+Washington+98112&amp;gl=us&amp;ll=47.639102,-122.277089&amp;spn=0.007735,0.01929&amp;t=h&amp;z=14&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;source=embed\" style=\"color: #0000ff; text-align: left;\">View Larger Map</a></small></p>\n<p>The discussion of the city park with a fenced-off shoreline was kicked off this summer by <a href=\"http://www.djc.com/blogs/SeattleScape/2011/08/02/park-in-chains-on-lake-washington/\">a Daily Journal of Commerce blog post</a> about the potential new lake access -- and what, eventually in a future \"shoreline access\" improvement, could be a new Madison Park beach:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was also told recently that in 2003 the neighborhood was polled about whether they would prefer to see the fence removed, and apparently there was some objection.&nbsp; Well, excuse me, but Lake Washington shoreline is a precious, very finite commodity and public ownership and use of any part of that commodity is not the sole province of the nearby neighbors.&nbsp; All of us 600,000+ Seattleites who do not have the privilege of living on or near the water should have the right to enjoy what little public shoreline the City owns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Details on the hearing are below.

If it is preserved, expect some neighborhood entertainment as the more than 100-year-old house will need to moved offsite during construction of the project.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">NK is also planning to drop the total units in the project to 24 and is looking at plans that would eliminate the 10 underground parking spots in an effort to reduce the mass of the project and lower its height.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The parking question is a good illustration of dilemmas faced by the project. On one hand, adjacent neighbors and people working to create the new park would prefer a shorter, smaller building. On the other, neighbors down the street probably aren't looking forward to increased demand in street parking if the project is built with no underground lot. \"We're never going to make everybody happy,\" Nicholson admits. It's an understatement -- and a reality -- of developing in a zone designed for change.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Below is the Capitol Hill Design Review Early Design Guidance report from DPD.

On Friday afternoon there was a luncheon and pep rally, followed by a tailgate party at the high school before the homecoming football game on Saturday.<br />\n<img class=\"main\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/images/1951_champs2.jpg\" /><br />\nRuss Quackenbush was a senior wide receiver on the team. &#8220;It was a great group of guys. I think that&#8217;s what was so neat about it,&#8221; he tells us about that 1951 team. &#8220;There were no stars, no two or three guys who made it happen. It was all of us, offensively and defensively. It was a special group of guys.&#8221;<br />\n<img class=\"main\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/images/1951_champs1.jpg\" /><br />\n<em>The 1951 undefeated state champs. Russ Quackenbush is third from the right.</em></p>\n<p>During half time of Saturday&#8217;s game, the team was honored in front of a sea of red and black. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s very special. None of us anticipated all this that&#8217;s been done for us,&#8221; Quackenbush says. &#8220;In fact I think it makes it more of an event now than it was when it happened.&#8221;<br />\n<img class=\"main\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/images/homecom3.jpg\" /><br />\nMany of the players on the 1951 team started working out together in the summer of that year at the Loyal Heights Field House.  Not only did they go undefeated that year, but Ballard outscored its opponents by 187-8.<br />\n<img class=\"main\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/images/homecom7.jpg\" /><br />\nTwo players were nominated All-American: Mel McCain and Arleigh Hiersch.  Seven others made the all-city team.   And in the Thanksgiving Day game, Ballard beat Bremerton 14 to 13.<br />\n<img class=\"main\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/images/homecom1.jpg\" /><br />\nAnd the champs weren&#8217;t disappointed at last night&#8217;s homecoming game against Garfield.  Ballard dominated the night, winning 26 to 7 at Memorial Stadium.<br />\n<img class=\"main\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/images/homecom2.jpg\" /><br />\n<b>Update:</b> With the game in the bag, we left a little early, missing a brawl in the fourth quarter.  The bench-clearing altercation ended with eight players (three from Ballard) being ejected from the game. &#8220;We&#8217;d like to show more class and more integrity than that. But we&#8217;ll use it as a teaching moment,&#8221; Ballard coach Joey Thomas (above) <a href=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/highschoolsports/2016456711_ringer10.html\">told the Seattle Times</a>.

Meantime, WSB&#8217;ers have shared photos from two different angles as the Justin was brought up &#8211; we&#8217;re adding those into this story. Spending the day on an open sliver of land to watch the progress, we met many interesting people. But one in particular framed the situation in a unique perspective &#8211; a woman who identified herself as the girlfriend of the Justin&#8217;s namesake owner. She said she hadn&#8217;t had much time to talk to him since it happened; she sat on the rocks on the same bit of shore where we were all day, waiting, wondering, worrying. As for why the converted landing craft sank &#8211; the official investigation will take time.</p>\n<p><strong>10:25 PM:</strong> Another update from the Coast Guard, which says, now that the Justin is out of the water: &#8220;Prior to repairs being done, Coast Guard and Wash. Dept. of Ecology investigators will examine the vessel in an attempt to determine what caused it to sink. Shoreline assessments of the beaches near Lowman Beach and Lincoln parks will resume at sunrise.  A helicopter will also be used at sunrise to assess the evaporation and breakup of the light weathered diesel ribbons that remain.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>11:19 PM:</strong> Excellent night shots in <a href=\"http://www.mortgageporter.com/beach_drive/2011/10/just-in-justin.html\" target=\"_blank\">the latest Beach Drive Blog update</a>.

(Here&#8217;s <a href=\"http://westseattleblog.com/2011/10/boat-reportedly-sinks-off-beach-drive-no-one-on-board\" target=\"_blank\">our original Friday report chronicling the situation</a> throughout Friday morning/afternoon; here&#8217;s <a href=\"http://westseattleblog.com/2011/10/beach-drive-sinkingspill-update-vessel-raising-tomorrow\" target=\"_blank\">our Friday night update</a>.) Crews resumed work at first light as promised; our crew at the scene says that so far, there&#8217;s been a lot of positioning, in hopes the sunken vessel can be brought up as soon as possible. We&#8217;ll be covering it as the operation continues.</p>\n<p><strong>10:21 AM UPDATE:</strong> The salvage operation continues to proceed slowly. According to a source at the scene who didn&#8217;t want to be identified, the Justin is in about 25 feet of water, where riggings are being attached to it for a careful lift-out, but divers and underwater photography shows the water is clear &#8211; no sign of any ongoing major leak. That&#8217;s also good news along West Seattle beaches. We just talked with an interagency team that has been walking the beaches of Lincoln and Lowman Beach Parks, including U.S. Coast Guard and state Ecology Dept. reps. </p>\n<p><center><img src=\"http://westseattleblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ecologyvan.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<p>They told us everything &#8220;is looking good&#8221; &#8211; no signs of oil damage to the beaches (though some of the diesel sheen was reported ashore north of Lowman yesterday) and no oiled or otherwise-harmed wildlife. A protective stretch of absorbent material is in place to protect the shore along Lowman:</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"http://westseattleblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/absorbent.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<p> The latest Coast Guard news release notes, &#8220;A Coast Guard overflight was launched at first light today and while there is still an oil sheen in the water that was released yesterday, it is very broken up and not recoverable.  This oil will continue to weather, dissipate and evaporate through natural wave and wind action.&#8221; We photographed the USCG chopper:</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"http://westseattleblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/coastguard.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<p>And here&#8217;s a look at activity offshore:</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"http://westseattleblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/nrcskiff.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<p><strong>12:39 PM UPDATE:</strong> To answer the most popular question from passers-by &#8211; No, it&#8217;s not out yet. The crane maneuvering continues, off and on; so does the skimming of water right alongside the barge, where the Justin went down.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"http://westseattleblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/absorb.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<p><strong>2:16 PM UPDATE:</strong> It&#8217;s a painstaking process. The crane pulleys move a little here, a little there. The drama is going on beneath the surface, we&#8217;re told. Among the ever-changing cast of characters at what&#8217;s become the semi-official viewpoint on shore for this operation is someone who knows the sunken craft&#8217;s owner and quotes him as saying, as of a half-hour or so, they were working on &#8220;flipping&#8221; it. A little earlier, we caught the photo you see above, as what appeared to be soiled absorbent material was hauled out of the water &#8211; NOT indicative of a wider spill, we should note, but perhaps from the sunken craft itself.</p>\n<p><strong>2:33 PM: Beach Drive Blog,</strong> which is headquartered within view of the site, says they&#8217;re seeing a bit of the craft &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.mortgageporter.com/beach_drive/2011/10/raising-justin.html\" target=\"_blank\">check their updated coverage here.</a></p>\n<p><center><img src=\"http://westseattleblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/continuing.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<p><strong>3:09 PM:</strong> Progress continues.

We&#8217;ve leaned a little more about the sunken vessel. It&#8217;s named after its operator, who is out on the barge as part of the operation. If you&#8217;re watching from shore parallel to the scene, most of what&#8217;s happening is between the big barge in the background and the crane superstructure that says &#8220;American Construction.&#8221; Intermittently, you can hear the screeching and grinding of the pulleys and other equipment involved.</p>\n<p><strong>5:32 PM:</strong> Finally it&#8217;s significantly visible &#8211; the wheelhouse and beyond- from where we have spent the past 10-plus hours:</p>\n<p><center></center></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the red structure, with a life ring on the left.</p>\n<p><strong>6:21 PM:</strong> In case you have this one bookmarked &#8211; we&#8217;ve started a new story to track what happens next: <a href=\"http://westseattleblog.com/2011/10/video-sunken-landing-craft-finally-raised-off-beach-drive\" target=\"_blank\">find it here.</a></p>",

Shore-side response crews have deployed boom along the shoreline in the waters just of the beach near the incident site in an effort to prevent further shore impact.</p>\n<p>Two miles of impacted shoreline have been surveyed.  A majority of the shoreline impact is very light which makes clean-up efforts ineffective and may actually cause more harm than good.  However, shoreline clean-up crews have identified areas on the beach with pockets of oil and clean up operations are underway in these areas.</p>\n<p>An Incident Command Post has been established at Coast Guard Sector Puget Sound that includes representative from the Washington Department of Ecology, U.S. Coast Guard, and representatives from the responsible party.</p>\n<p>The Incident Commanders have set the following objectives:</p>\n<p>*Secure the source of the spill<br />\n*Stabilize the sunken vessel<br />\n*Remove as much oil as possible from the water<br />\n*Stabilize the barge<br />\n*Salvage the sunken vessel<br />\n*Monitor shoreline impact and deploy mitigation equipment as necessary.</p>\n<p>The spilled product that remains on the surface of the water is expected to dissipate.  Salvage operations will continue throughout the evening with divers focusing on plugging fuel vents securing the spill source.  A 150-ton crane barge is being mobilized to be used to lift the vessel from the bottom early tomorrow during daylight.</p>\n<p>A 500 yard safety zone is still in effect around the spill site.  Mariners are reminded to stay clear of the Safety Zone until it is cancelled.  The public is reminded to avoid contact with any of the spilled fuel or oil in the water or any fuel or oil that may reach the beach.  If anyone discovers diesel fuel or oil on the beach, they should report it to the Coast Guard Sector Puget Sound at 206-217-6001/2</i></p></blockquote>\n<p>We&#8217;ll be checking back through the evening and will add any new developments; <strong><a href=\"http://beachdriveblog.com\">Beach Drive Blog</a></strong> has been updating all day too.</p>",

The ice cream shop on the corner of Greenwood Avenue North and North 74th Street had its ice cream cart out in front of the store for much of the summer, whetting people\u2019s appetites for its locally produced ice cream.</p>\n<p>Josh Reynolds started Bluebird on Capitol Hill about 2-1/2 years ago. Bluebird is also opening up a small ice cream shop in Fremont soon.</p>\n<p>Bluebird works with local farmers and businesses for all its ingredients, including CB\u2019s Nuts in Kingston for its peanut butter ice cream, Elysian Brewery, Caffe Vita, and Theo Chocolates.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cool cultural thing to play on each other\u2019s strengths,\u201d\u00a0Reynolds said.</p>\n<p>Bluebird will eventually replace the front windows with a garage door, just like neighboring Caffe Vita and Cornuto, and will extend the back porch to connect with those two businesses. Bluebird also will eventually have a door straight into Caffe Vita (you can see the old doorway is already framed in on Caffe Vita\u2019s side, where the condiment station is, and Reynolds said the door is already framed\u00a0inside the drywall on Bluebird&#8217;s side). Reynolds said he has a good working relationship with both businesses, and all three businesses want to work together to make everyone successful.</p>\n<p>When I stopped in for a sneak peek last Wednesday, Reynolds and Store Manager Ashleigh Byrne were busy cleaning as the last bit of construction finishes up. Reynolds was happy to find the building\u2019s original hardwood floors under layers of laminate during construction.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.phinneywood.com/2011/10/10/bluebird-microcreamery-opening-phinney-ice-cream-shop-on-friday/ashleigh-josh-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-7148\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7148\" height=\"338\" src=\"http://www.phinneywood.com/wp-content/uploads/Ashleigh-Josh1.jpg\" title=\"Ashleigh-Josh\" width=\"450\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>Store Manager Ashleigh Byrne (left) and Owner Josh Reynolds (right) discuss remaining construction details last Wednesday.</em></p>\n<p>Bluebird passed its King County Department of Health inspection last Thursday, and its Department and Planning &amp; Development inspection on Monday.</p>\n<p>A few tables will be placed up front by the windows, and there will be counter seating on the north wall. A floor-to-ceiling blackboard will announce daily flavors, which usually numbers about 12. Reynolds said there are usually six or seven flavors that remain day-to-day, and others come and go with the season or their own whims.</p>\n<p>He said one of their past flavors, Peanut Butter and Jelly, was created when the 10-year-old son of a neighboring toy store on Capitol Hill suggested it. When Reynolds said the kid could just get a scoop of peanut butter and a scoop of marionberry ice creams, the boy patiently explained that if they swirled it together, it would sell better.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe do take flavor suggestions,\u201d Reynolds said with a smile.</p>\n<p>Bluebird currently makes all of its ice cream at its Capitol Hill shop, but it\u2019s outgrowing the space, so Reynolds plans to eventually move production to the back room of the Phinney Ridge store.</p>\n<p>\u201cEventually we\u2019re going to use that space and put in a big window so you can see ice cream being made,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Bluebird also will produce its own craft sodas and beer there. They\u2019ll have traditional ales plus their own fun brews, like a Chocolate Stout or Coconut Porter, and they\u2019ll fill growlers as well as use the beers and sodas (such as sarsaparilla, root beer and cream soda) for ice cream floats.</p>\n<p>Bluebird will make shakes with its 1950s Hamilton Beach milkshake machine\u00a0in vintage sea foam green.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe look of (the shop) isn\u2019t trying to be retro, but I definitely like old classic things,\u201d Reynolds said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.phinneywood.com/2011/10/10/bluebird-microcreamery-opening-phinney-ice-cream-shop-on-friday/josh-ice-cream-maker-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-7149\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7149\" height=\"338\" src=\"http://www.phinneywood.com/wp-content/uploads/Josh-ice-cream-maker1.jpg\" title=\"Josh-ice-cream-maker\" width=\"450\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>Reynolds demonstrates the vintage milkshake machine. The floor-to-ceiling chalkboard is on the left, and the wall above the sinks in the back will eventually be replaced with windows so patrons can see ice cream being made in the back room.</em></p>\n<p>Reynolds got into the ice cream business because so many people told him his homemade\u00a0ice cream was so good that he could sell it. Reynolds was previously a teacher and the director of an outdoor environmental center in upstate New York. When the economy collapsed in 2008 and real estate prices fell, Reynolds saw an opportunity to start his business and found his space on Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p>He said ice cream is an indulgence, but a small one that people can easily justify. And he\u2019s happy to put in the hours to make his business successful.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not been an overnight success\u2026but it\u2019s been heading in the right direction for two years. I\u2019ve lost a bunch of weight working in an ice cream shop,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m working every day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bluebird&#8217;s hours will be 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. to start, but will change depending on the neighborhood&#8217;s tastes.</p>",

Evening Magazine&#8217;s Best of Western Washington. I was thrilled beyond belief at this news! But then I was quickly humbled when I realized I was up against THE MAN (chain salons). Last time I checked the polls our salon was in 3rd, 7 Salon was in 2nd and Gene Juarez was in 1st.</p>\n<p>This David and Goliath story can end with the little guy winning. How? Anyone who believes in Seattle small businesses, anyone who believes in a mom and pop shop actually surviving, anyone who believes in your local neighborhood joint staying open even though corporate outfits move in down the street should vote for the underdog. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, if you love Gene Juarez you should vote for them. But if you don&#8217;t love them and your salon that you go to isn&#8217;t in 3rd place . . . . . . then vote for Frederick&#8217;s.</p></blockquote>",

Arsonist Kevin Todd Swalwell was <a href=\"http://www.phinneywood.com/2010/05/28/greenwood-arsonist-sentenced-to-30-years/\">sentenced to 30 years</a> for setting the early-morning fire on Oct. 23, 2009, that burned down the building, as well as several other fires.</p>\n<p>The new two-story, 12,200 square foot project needs an environmental review, design review, and liquor license approval. The <a href=\"http://web1.seattle.gov/dpd/luib/Notice.aspx?BID=654&amp;NID=12745\">public can comment</a> on the plans through Oct. 12.</p>\n<p>The building will be LEED certified (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), and will include a large lobby with a caf\u00e9 that will be open seven days a week and into the evenings, a scene shop, a second theater with 120 seats, and staff offices upstairs.</p>\n<p>The new building will be about 88 feet long, with a wall of storefront windows on the ground level, and &#8220;punch-out&#8221; windows (with no glass) on the second floor with a small garden.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.phinneywood.com/2011/10/05/taproot-theatre-applies-for-master-use-permit-to-replace-neighboring-building-destroyed-by-arson/taproot-revised-millerhull/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-7045\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7045\" height=\"264\" src=\"http://www.phinneywood.com/wp-content/uploads/Taproot-revised-MillerHull.jpg\" title=\"Taproot-revised-MillerHull\" width=\"450\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>Revised drawing of Taproot Theatre&#8217;s new building. By <a href=\"http://www.millerhull.com/html/home.htm\">The Miller Hull Partnership</a>.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of light; a lot of steel and a lot of light,\u201d Producing Artistic Director Scott Nolte says. \u201cWe\u2019re calling it neo-Greenwood.\u201d</p>\n<p>That second theater is what they\u2019re calling a \u201cblack box theater,\u201d with collapsible seating that goes into the wall, opening up the space for rehearsals and events. The seats will be arranged in six rows of 20 seats. The grade of seating between rows is much greater than in Taproot\u2019s Mainstage theater. Seats will be padded with armrests, and motorized to collapse.</p>\n<p>Taproot doesn\u2019t even have a true scene shop right now; they use the backstage area to build new sets for the mainstage and the touring company.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey can\u2019t really start working on things until our current show closes,\u201d Nolte explains. \u201cThat means the turnaround time between shows is really, really frenetic.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nolte says having a dedicated scene shop will give them more time to build, and allow flexibility in scheduling.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt means the turnaround time between the plays doesn\u2019t have to be three weeks, it might be 10 days,\u201d he says. \u201cSo if there\u2019s a play that\u2019s going especially well, let\u2019s add another week to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>And the lobby caf\u00e9 will serve theater patrons and passersby alike, during the day and evening.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt especially serves us when there\u2019s a play happening, but also during the rest of the week,\u201d Nolte says of the cafe. \u201cThere are way too many storefronts for lease in downtown Greenwood. And after 6 o\u2019clock at night there\u2019s not a single building that\u2019s lit up on that corner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nolte says the theater is waiting for a final bid from its builder. Taproot is still conducting its $3.3 million fundraising campaign to pay for the new building, retire the mortgage on the current theater, and put some money into an emergency reserve fund. The current building\u2019s mortgage has about $170,000 remaining.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe whole thrust of the campaign is to really make sure we\u2019re on solid financial footing,&#8221; Nolte says.</p>",

Many business owners rely on popular social media sites, like Facebook and Twitter, to survive.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sweetandsavorypie.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pie</a> (3515 Fremont Ave N), is among the local businesses that use social media to engage customers. The restaurant, which specializes in sweet and savory mini pies, maintains both a <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/sweetnsavorypie\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Pie-Fremont-Seattle-WA/165289150170021\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> page.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good way to reach a lot of people in a very short amount of time,\u201d said Jess Whitsitt, co-owner of Pie. Whitsitt created a Facebook page for the business, four months before it even opened. \u201cI thought it would be good to start teaching people what we were about to come out with,\u201d she said. The restaurant posts daily menus and sometimes they tweet three to four times a day.</p>\n<p>Whitsitt believes that Pie wouldn\u2019t be nearly as successful without social media. \u201cI think it would have taken us a lot longer to build our client base,\u201d she said. \u201cWe opened to many customers the very first day that we were in business.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pie customers interact and contribute their ideas, for flavors, through social media. The restaurant has 618 followers on Twitter and 1,192 \u201cLikes\u201d on Facebook. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to get feedback from people and see smiles on their faces via the internet,\u201d Whitsitt said. \u201cI guess that\u2019s the way they\u2019re showing us that they appreciate what we do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Because of the high cost of print advertising, Whitsitt only uses social media to promote the restaurant.<a href=\"http://http://www.dustystrings.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Dusty Strings</a> Music School (3406 Fremont Ave N) also connects with customers through Facebook. Up until four years ago the music school communicated with students through The Quarter Note, a quarterly newsletter.</p>\n<p>Adam Burdick, the music school director, created a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dusty-Strings-Music-School/116839128311\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook page</a> for the school a year and half ago. Events, special workshops and information about classes are all posted on the school\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cI know that [Facebook] is definitely creating more awareness that we\u2019re here,\u201d Burdick said.</p>\n<p>While the music school uses Facebook to connect with students regularly, the music store Dusty Strings isn\u2019t using social media yet. \u201cIt takes a certain amount of effort to be fresh, to post something everyday,\u201d Burdick said. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been the focus of providing that. It just hasn\u2019t happened, but as people see the value of Facebook for the school it will happen for the store as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dusty Strings co-manager Gary Davidson, likes the immediate response of connecting online. \u201cWhile we have not been on the cutting edge of using social media, we do recognize there are a lot of people using it,\u201d he said.  Davidson added that it\u2019s hard to measure the impact that social media has on the school, but it has contributed to the attendance for some musical events.</p>\n<p>Lance Brough, owner of <a href=\"http://www.kylieschicagopizza.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kylie\u2019s Chicago Pizza</a>, admits that sometimes it\u2019s hard to draw attention online. \u201cBigger pizza places struggle with how to connect and how to make it relevant,\u201d he said. The pizza joint uses <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kylies-Chicago-Pizza/291042892828\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>, Foursquare and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/deepdishseattle\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> to promote specials and charity events. \u201cIt\u2019s a good way to have an information hub,\u201d Brough said. \u201cA lot of restaurants are able to connect with customers and people that don\u2019t know about their business.\u201d</p>\n<p>Without interactive websites and during a time where most people tweet, businesses like Kylie\u2019s Chicago Pizza know that they have to be pro-active about shaping their business online. Brough says that sites like Twitter help build relationships. \u201cAs an individual they take the time to send a tweet that says something about your business,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Brough says that they\u2019re considering a Google+ page. They\u2019re still thinking about whether they will use their current social media sites and Google+, or if they will concentrate on one site.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe world is changing all the time, and I think to have a strong presence [online] is very important,\u201d Brough said. \u201cWe have a presence, but we need to have a better presence.\u201d</p>",

The customer then noticed that his checking account had two $500 withdrawals made from different ATMs.<br />\nThe man and his girlfriend deduced that the Chase bank ATM was the only one they had used together and that it had the skimmer stuck to it. A skimmer is a hard-to-detect device sometimes affixed to the card slot of an ATM which records card information. Other times, scammers use a hidden camera near the ATM to sneak peeks at card PIN numbers.<br />\nThe man called Chase Bank and the manager told him other customers had made similar complaints.<br />\nAnyone who has used that ATM in the recent months should check their accounts and verify they haven&#8217;t been victims and/or cancel their card and have a new one reissued.<br />\n<em>Thanks G for the tip.</em></p>",

So King County\u2019s Department of Natural Resources and Parks (DNRP) is replacing them in a two-part project. The DNRP will replace the old pipes by nesting plastic pipes inside each of them. And in anticipation of more demand on the system over the next several decades, the department will add a third pipe by digging a tunnel well beneath Salmon Bay.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_6170\" style=\"width: 460px;\"><a href=\"http://www.magnoliavoice.com/uploads/SiphonOriginal2.gif\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"main&quot;size-full\" height=\"321\" src=\"http://www.magnoliavoice.com/uploads/SiphonOriginal2.gif\" title=\"SiphonOriginal2\" width=\"450\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>The original wooden-stave sewage pipe was built in 1935.

At that staging area, crews will dig a hole about 120-feet deep, and do the same on the Magnolia side. Then a tunnel-boring machine will be put in the hole where it will bore out the pipe corridor 120 feet under the bay. The new pipe will be 84-inches wide, and, combined with the new twin pipes, is expected to handle community sewage through this century.

The loan is at 0.5-percent interest over 20 years. The State Department of Ecology is also loaning the county $31,850,000 for construction costs.

The &#8216;P&#8217; commemorates the family who used to farm the area that became the first community garden in Seattle, the Picardo Farm P-Patch. This P-Patch was acquired from the Picardo family who ran a truck farm in the earlier part of the 1900s up in the Wedgwood neighborhood. Their farm originally included the current P-Patch area, University Prep and Dahl Playfield. When the city started up the P-Patch program in 1973, the &#8216;P&#8217; was taken to commemorate the family.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The new work includes includes re-plotting the south field paths and beds, installing a new irrigation system, extending and enhancing the planting on the south hillside to include native and edible plants as well as two specialized gardens; a bamboo cutting garden and a mushroom garden.</p>\n<p>A permanent kids&#8217; garden will be planned, as well as dedicated food bank beds are also planned, with the hope that not only Picardo gardeners, but community groups adopt and grow food bank crops.</p>",

Already, the group has helped about 30 residents in Queen Anne add solar systems, and residents in Magnolia now are registering for their own program.</p>\n<p>The incentives:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In addition to not paying for the electricity that the solar panels produce, the state also pays you 15 cents for each of those kilowatt-hours \u2014 an amount that rises to 54 cents for people who purchase solar panels made in-state.</li>\n<li>The state doesn&#8217;t charge sales tax on solar panels.</li>\n<li>The federal government offers a 30-percent federal tax credit for the purchase and installation of solar panels.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Raker adds that residents who register for the Solarize Seattle program are under no obligation to purchase anything, it&#8217;s simply a way to get you in their database so they can send you information about upcoming meetings and help you make an appointment to meet with the contractor. Through the program, the contractor will give you a free assessment, and any decisions you make from there out are just between you and the contractor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re technical assistance,&#8221; Raker explained. &#8220;We&#8217;re really there to help the community get up to speed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or would like to volunteer to help spread the word, email Raker at <a href=\"mailto:jessica@nwseed.org\">jessica@nwseed.org</a> or Alex Sawyer at <a href=\"mailto:alex@nwseed.org\">alex@nwseed.org</a>.</p>",

Orange is the walk zone, yellow the bus zone.</em></p>\n<p>The new neighborhood-based transportation system is expected to streamline bus routs for attendance-area students and get kids to their neighborhood school in 25 minutes or less. This change will also save an estimate $4 million by using fewer buses and less gas. \u201cWith more efficient routing, buses are less likely to encounter the traffic delays that occur on longer routes, so families will find departure and arrival times to be more reliable,\u201d said Tom Bishop, SPS transportation manager. \u201cIn addition, the more streamlined routes will also benefit the environment by taking up to 80 buses off the roads and reducing the district\u2019s carbon footprint.\u201d</p>\n<p>Students within the transportation zone, but outside the walk zone for a school will be eligible for district-provided transportation. There are an estimated 3,600 elementary students who live outside the new transportation zones. They will still be eligible for the following transportation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<li>Students who live within a half of a mile from the Transportation Zone boundary can walk to a yellow bus stop within the zone. Seats will be allocated on a space-available basis.</li>\n<li>Community stops will be created so students can catch a yellow bus near an attendance area school and take it to another school.</li>\n<li>Students who are no longer eligible for transportation will receive a guaranteed assignment to their attendance area school, if requested.</li>\n</blockquote>\n<p>School bus routes will be assigned later this summer once all the students assignments are complete. Families should expect a letter later this month, prior to the start of the school year. </p>\n<p>For more information and to see the transportation zone for your school, <a href=\"http://district.seattleschools.org/modules/cms/pages.phtml?sessionid=7c346566a982e4ec2bddb2c65c88414e&#038;pageid=216138&#038;sessionid=7c346566a982e4ec2bddb2c65c88414e\">click here</a>.

From <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/19/us-marijuana-seattle-idUSTRE76I0MF20110719\">Reuters</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The 8-0 vote in favor of the measure comes  nearly three months after Governor Christine Gregoire signed into law a  new measure allowing cities to regulate and license production,  processing and distribution of medical marijuana on a limited basis.</p>\n<p>That  statute, which takes effect on Friday, requires storefront dispensaries  and other medical pot suppliers to reorganize themselves as small,  cooperative ventures serving up to 10 patients. These &#8220;collective gardens&#8221; are confined to growing 45 plants total but no more than 15 per person.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This vote is a ground-breaking move for Washington, and is the farthest any city in the state has gone toward legitimizing medical marijuana usage. Dispensaries and co-ops citywide would benefit from the licensing decision. From <a href=\"http://mynorthwest.com/?nid=11&amp;sid=513118\">MyNorthwest.com</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cThey\u2019re not kicking the can down the road and having  somebody else deal  with it,\u201d [Dockside Co-Op owner Oscar] Velasco-Schmitz says.   \u201cThey realize that there is a need for  medical cannibis within the  community, and they\u2019re taking steps to be  able to provide that for the  community in a safe manner.\u201d </em></p></blockquote>\n<p>While Seattle has taken measures to license medical marijuana dispensaries, such businesses are still in violation of federal law. If signed by Mayor Mike McGinn, the proposed ordinance would require medical  marijuana businesses to comply with city codes, governing everything  from plumbing to public nuisance complaints. From Reuters:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Seattle officials backing the proposed city  ordinance say more than 25,000 of the city&#8217;s 600,000 residents use  cannabis for medical reasons. They argue that regulation will bring more  order to the burgeoning supply chain.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re saying, &#8216;You&#8217;re already here, now we need to regulate you,&#8217;&#8221; Seattle Councilwoman Sally Clark said.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Clark told Reuters that some 80 medical marijuana dispensaries have  sprung up in Seattle over the last few years, but of those, only about 50 have officially registered with the  city. The mayor is expected to sign the ordinance as early as Tuesday. Once signed, the measure would go into effect in 30 days.</p>\n<p>But not all medical marijuana proponents are praising the decision. Medical marijuana attorney Douglas Hiatt told <a href=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2015652874_apwamedicalmarijuanaseattle.html\">The Seattle Times</a> he&#8217;s planning to sue the city to block the action. &#8220;He  says marijuana remains illegal under both federal and state law, and the  city does not have authority to regulate an illegal substance,&#8221; according to the Times.</p>\n<p>And while we\u2019re on the topic, check out these recent stories on <a href=\"http://www.myballard.com/from-green-to-gray/\" target=\"_blank\">the gray area that exists in the world of medical marijuana</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.mywallingford.com/2011/07/13/wallingfords-cannabis-farmers-market/\" target=\"_blank\">Wallingford Cannabis Farmer\u2019s Market</a>.</p>",

Neither the <a href=\"http://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/\">Seattle Department of Neighborhoods</a> nor the <a href=\"http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/\">Seattle Department of Transportation</a> could immediately explain the misspelling of the street sign.</p>\n<p>In the late summer of 1855, surveyor <strong>David Phillips</strong> stumbled upon a lake, now known as Green Lake. On the map submitted to the Surveyor General of the United States, this body of water was referred to as \u201cLake Green\u201d due to the algae blooms in the marshy waters.</p>\n<p>Today, Green Lake is the center of a park, with community facilities and a vibrant surrounding neighborhood. <strong>Dewey Potter</strong>, communications manager of <a href=\"http://www.seattle.gov/parks/\">Seattle Parks and Recreation</a>, explained that the correct spelling of both the neighborhood and the park is two words.</p>\n<p>Potter has worked for Seattle Parks and Recreation since 1993 and said she \u201cnoticed the misuse of the word [Greenlake] right away and I correct them all the time!\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Maryte Racys</strong>, a librarian at the Seattle Public Library, hypothesized that local businesses coined the one-word spelling, while \u201cothers are following suit out of practicality.\u201d</p>\n<p>Racys noted that the <a href=\"http://www.neighborhoodgrills.com/greenlake/\">Greenlake Bar and Grill</a> was one of the first businesses to use the spelling \u201cGreenlake.\u201d Located at <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=7200+E.+Green+Lake+Drive+N.&amp;ll=47.680804,-122.325726&amp;spn=0.008365,0.01929&amp;hnear=7200+East+Green+Lake+Dr+N,+Seattle,+King,+Washington+98115&amp;gl=us&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;iwloc=A\">7200 E Green Lake Drive N</a>, the restaurant is in a central location just north of the lake.

According to Assistant Manager <strong>Dione Taitch</strong>, the golf course\u2019s spelling has always been one word, which is consistent with many other local businesses. \u201cI don\u2019t exactly know why the founders chose to use one word and it wasn\u2019t until recently that people started asking,\u201d Taitch said.</p>\n<p>\u201cA couple of years ago I noticed the street signs,\u201d Taitch explained with a small laugh, \u201cand wondered if [the name of the lake] had always been that way because I\u2019d always thought it was one word.\u201d</p>\n<p>Members of the community have different guesses.<strong> Sarah Heck</strong>, a resident of the Green Lake neighborhood for eight years, mused, \u201cI hadn\u2019t really thought about the differences in spelling until now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Heck said she has always thought the name \u201cGreen Lake\u201d was referring specifically to the lake. Green Lake residents \u201cprobably started using one word to describe the neighborhood to differentiate from the lake,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Although Heck does not think inconsistency in spelling is a pressing problem, she said, \u201cIt would be cool to know why people in Seattle diverted from the traditional spelling.\u201d</p>\n<p>The origins of the one-word spelling of \u201cGreenlake\u201d remain a mystery. As Racys explained, \u201cI don\u2019t have a definitive answer\u2014I don\u2019t think anyone does.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p><small>\u00a9UW News Lab for <a href=\"http://www.mygreenlake.com\">My Green Lake | Seattle&#039;s Green Lake Blog</a>, 2011. \n<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.mygreenlake.com/2011/10/greenlake-green-lake-two-words/\">Permalink</a> | <strong><a href=\"http://www.mygreenlake.com/2011/10/greenlake-green-lake-two-words/#comments\">Comment on this post</a> </strong>\n<br /><br />\nPost tags: <a href=\"http://www.mygreenlake.com/tag/historical/\" rel=\"tag\">historical</a><br />\n</small></p><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MyGreenLake/~4/wIpCL-VNH0E\" width=\"1\" />",

Typically, Australian and New Zealand fans are dire enemies, but at the Green Lake pub, they come together in a camaraderie that would be unlikely in the Antipodes.</p>\n<p>New Zealand is favored, although they&#8217;re weakened by injuries, while Australia is surprising, as it went into the tournament with no great expectations. New Zealand is not at all assured of advancing to next week&#8217;s final.</p>\n<p>The Kangaroo &amp; Kiwi will be packed tomorrow night, as most likely it will be for tonight&#8217;s game (also 1am) in which France, brilliant but erratic, takes on Wales, the surprise team of the tournament, big, fast, and powerful.</p>\n<p>There sometimes is a modest cover charge for these big telecasts. That will be worth paying, just to see what a crowd of rabid rugby fans from Australasia is like.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><small>\u00a9Amy Duncan for <a href=\"http://www.mygreenlake.com\">My Green Lake | Seattle&#039;s Green Lake Blog</a>, 2011. \n<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.mygreenlake.com/2011/10/rugby-world-cup/\">Permalink</a> | <strong><a href=\"http://www.mygreenlake.com/2011/10/rugby-world-cup/#comments\">Comment on this post</a> </strong>\n<br /><br />\nPost tags: <a href=\"http://www.mygreenlake.com/tag/aurora/\" rel=\"tag\">aurora</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mygreenlake.com/tag/bars/\" rel=\"tag\">bars</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mygreenlake.com/tag/local-businesses/\" rel=\"tag\">local businesses</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mygreenlake.com/tag/rugby/\" rel=\"tag\">rugby</a><br />\n</small></p><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MyGreenLake/~4/qvGLlQMT3nQ\" width=\"1\" />",

    "article_text": "<p><strong>By Mwiza Kalisa</strong></p>\n<p>The Wallingford Community Council held a meeting yesterday to discuss changes of the zoning code that would accommodate an office building on Stone Way, between 34th and 35th streets. Community members gathered at the Good Sheperd Center to voice their concerns and to hear from Skanska, the developer.</p>\n<p>Last night the community council reached a decision to appeal the code change that potentially increases the height limit of the building from 45 feet to 65 feet. The residents who attended the meeting had different views about the plans to amend the zoning code.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe problem is this is only a pilot project and the requirements are so loose that tomorrow is the deadline for appealing a preliminary environmental review by the city. Basically it would allow an extra 20 feet on top of the current zoning without any guarantee that you get a Living Building,\u201d said Lee Raeen, President of the Wallingford Community Council.</p>\n<p>Lisa Picard, Executive Vice President at Skanska, discussed the benefits of the tall office building. \u201cThis site is critical to connect the community and have a vibrant base and a vibrant floor, we\u2019re going to do everything to ensure its success,\u201d Picard said at the meeting. She also mentioned that there are concerns about parking, but that the project has 250 parking stalls planned. \u201cThe employees are provided parking but they are given incentives to essentially commute in a different way,\u201d she added.</p>\n<p>The building would accommodate 300 employees, some residents see this as an opportunity to create more jobs. Those in favor of increasing the height limit mentioned that it\u2019s a wonderful opportunity for businesses and that the neighborhood would be more vibrant. The tenant was not revealed at last nights meeting, the only information Skanska provided is that they are a \u201csports and lifestyle fitness company.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katherine Bragdon has lived in the Wallingford area since 1995. Although she supports the idea of a green building she\u2019s concerned about its impacts. \u201cThe Living Building program is exciting, I love the idea and our neighbors love the idea, but not at the cost of our neighborhood. Either keep it at 45 ft and keep it green, or have it moved to a neighborhood that is more appropriate for a building of that height, that build and that scale,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It\u2019s just too big, I feel like a 65 to 80 ft structure close to the water doesn\u2019t make sense. It contradicts the comprehensive plan that the city created and I feel like it also undermines the process that they had for years to keep the transfer station at its existing height. A potential 65 to 80 ft building dwarves almost everything in the area, it doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Bragdon added.</p>\n<p>A public hearing is scheduled at City Hall on Wednesday October 12 at 9 a.m.</p>",

Meantime, WSB&#8217;ers have shared photos from two different angles as the Justin was brought up &#8211; we&#8217;re adding those into this story. Spending the day on an open sliver of land to watch the progress, we met many interesting people. But one in particular framed the situation in a unique perspective &#8211; a woman who identified herself as the girlfriend of the Justin&#8217;s namesake owner. She said she hadn&#8217;t had much time to talk to him since it happened; she sat on the rocks on the same bit of shore where we were all day, waiting, wondering, worrying. As for why the converted landing craft sank &#8211; the official investigation will take time.</p>\n<p><strong>10:25 PM:</strong> Another update from the Coast Guard, which says, now that the Justin is out of the water: &#8220;Prior to repairs being done, Coast Guard and Wash. Dept. of Ecology investigators will examine the vessel in an attempt to determine what caused it to sink. Shoreline assessments of the beaches near Lowman Beach and Lincoln parks will resume at sunrise.  A helicopter will also be used at sunrise to assess the evaporation and breakup of the light weathered diesel ribbons that remain.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>11:19 PM:</strong> Excellent night shots in <a href=\"http://www.mortgageporter.com/beach_drive/2011/10/just-in-justin.html\" target=\"_blank\">the latest Beach Drive Blog update</a>.

The crane maneuvering continues, off and on; so does the skimming of water right alongside the barge, where the Justin went down.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"http://westseattleblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/absorb.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<p><strong>2:16 PM UPDATE:</strong> It&#8217;s a painstaking process. The crane pulleys move a little here, a little there. The drama is going on beneath the surface, we&#8217;re told. Among the ever-changing cast of characters at what&#8217;s become the semi-official viewpoint on shore for this operation is someone who knows the sunken craft&#8217;s owner and quotes him as saying, as of a half-hour or so, they were working on &#8220;flipping&#8221; it. A little earlier, we caught the photo you see above, as what appeared to be soiled absorbent material was hauled out of the water &#8211; NOT indicative of a wider spill, we should note, but perhaps from the sunken craft itself.</p>\n<p><strong>2:33 PM: Beach Drive Blog,</strong> which is headquartered within view of the site, says they&#8217;re seeing a bit of the craft &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.mortgageporter.com/beach_drive/2011/10/raising-justin.html\" target=\"_blank\">check their updated coverage here.</a></p>\n<p><center><img src=\"http://westseattleblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/continuing.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<p><strong>3:09 PM:</strong> Progress continues. That&#8217;s our latest view.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"http://westseattleblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/vessel.jpg\" /></center></p>\n<p><strong>4:19 PM UPDATE:</strong> And they&#8217;re still working on it! We&#8217;ve leaned a little more about the sunken vessel. It&#8217;s named after its operator, who is out on the barge as part of the operation. If you&#8217;re watching from shore parallel to the scene, most of what&#8217;s happening is between the big barge in the background and the crane superstructure that says &#8220;American Construction.&#8221; Intermittently, you can hear the screeching and grinding of the pulleys and other equipment involved.</p>\n<p><strong>5:32 PM:</strong> Finally it&#8217;s significantly visible &#8211; the wheelhouse and beyond- from where we have spent the past 10-plus hours:</p>\n<p><center></center></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the red structure, with a life ring on the left.</p>\n<p><strong>6:21 PM:</strong> In case you have this one bookmarked &#8211; we&#8217;ve started a new story to track what happens next: <a href=\"http://westseattleblog.com/2011/10/video-sunken-landing-craft-finally-raised-off-beach-drive\" target=\"_blank\">find it here.</a></p>",

Shore-side response crews have deployed boom along the shoreline in the waters just of the beach near the incident site in an effort to prevent further shore impact.</p>\n<p>Two miles of impacted shoreline have been surveyed.  A majority of the shoreline impact is very light which makes clean-up efforts ineffective and may actually cause more harm than good.  However, shoreline clean-up crews have identified areas on the beach with pockets of oil and clean up operations are underway in these areas.</p>\n<p>An Incident Command Post has been established at Coast Guard Sector Puget Sound that includes representative from the Washington Department of Ecology, U.S. Coast Guard, and representatives from the responsible party.</p>\n<p>The Incident Commanders have set the following objectives:</p>\n<p>*Secure the source of the spill<br />\n*Stabilize the sunken vessel<br />\n*Remove as much oil as possible from the water<br />\n*Stabilize the barge<br />\n*Salvage the sunken vessel<br />\n*Monitor shoreline impact and deploy mitigation equipment as necessary.</p>\n<p>The spilled product that remains on the surface of the water is expected to dissipate.  Salvage operations will continue throughout the evening with divers focusing on plugging fuel vents securing the spill source.  A 150-ton crane barge is being mobilized to be used to lift the vessel from the bottom early tomorrow during daylight.</p>\n<p>A 500 yard safety zone is still in effect around the spill site.  Mariners are reminded to stay clear of the Safety Zone until it is cancelled.  The public is reminded to avoid contact with any of the spilled fuel or oil in the water or any fuel or oil that may reach the beach.  If anyone discovers diesel fuel or oil on the beach, they should report it to the Coast Guard Sector Puget Sound at 206-217-6001/2</i></p></blockquote>\n<p>We&#8217;ll be checking back through the evening and will add any new developments; <strong><a href=\"http://beachdriveblog.com\">Beach Drive Blog</a></strong> has been updating all day too.</p>",
