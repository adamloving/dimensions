Shore-side response crews have deployed boom along the shoreline in the waters just of the beach near the incident site in an effort to prevent further shore impact.</p>\n<p>Two miles of impacted shoreline have been surveyed.  A majority of the shoreline impact is very light which makes clean-up efforts ineffective and may actually cause more harm than good.  However, shoreline clean-up crews have identified areas on the beach with pockets of oil and clean up operations are underway in these areas.</p>\n<p>An Incident Command Post has been established at Coast Guard Sector Puget Sound that includes representative from the Washington Department of Ecology, U.S. Coast Guard, and representatives from the responsible party.</p>\n<p>The Incident Commanders have set the following objectives:</p>\n<p>*Secure the source of the spill<br />\n*Stabilize the sunken vessel<br />\n*Remove as much oil as possible from the water<br />\n*Stabilize the barge<br />\n*Salvage the sunken vessel<br />\n*Monitor shoreline impact and deploy mitigation equipment as necessary.</p>\n<p>The spilled product that remains on the surface of the water is expected to dissipate.  Salvage operations will continue throughout the evening with divers focusing on plugging fuel vents securing the spill source.  A 150-ton crane barge is being mobilized to be used to lift the vessel from the bottom early tomorrow during daylight.</p>\n<p>A 500 yard safety zone is still in effect around the spill site.  Mariners are reminded to stay clear of the Safety Zone until it is cancelled.  The public is reminded to avoid contact with any of the spilled fuel or oil in the water or any fuel or oil that may reach the beach.  If anyone discovers diesel fuel or oil on the beach, they should report it to the Coast Guard Sector Puget Sound at 206-217-6001/2</i></p></blockquote>\n<p>We&#8217;ll be checking back through the evening and will add any new developments; <strong><a href=\"http://beachdriveblog.com\">Beach Drive Blog</a></strong> has been updating all day too.</p>",

We were down at the scene a little while ago and they were doing flyovers to gauge its size. There&#8217;s a 500-yard &#8220;safety zone&#8221; around the spill and, says the Coast Guard update, &#8220;An estimated 1,600 feet of hard boom and 300 feet of soft boom have been deployed to contain and absorb oil from the water.&#8221; They expect to continue cleanup till nightfall, and to resume it in the morning as needed; salvage operations for the sunken vessel will continue into the night.

Additional boom is on scene and ready to be deployed as needed.  Marine and shoreline emergency response trailers as well as vacuum trucks are standing by for additional support, should they be required.  In the first few hours, divers were brought in to plug fuel vents to stop the release of the fuel on board.  Salvage experts from Ballard Diving &#038; Salvage have been contracted by Waterfront Construction to perform underwater inspections of the vessel and create a salvage plan to raise the ex-military Landing Craft from the Puget Sound waters as quickly and safely as possible.</p>\n<p>\u201cWaterfront Construction appreciates the unified response that has been assisting with this unfortunate event and is doing everything in its power to clean the waters as quickly as possible\u201d, states Keith Landry, Project Manager of Waterfront Construction.</i></p></blockquote>\n<p>In a followup exchange, the spokesperson told us it&#8217;s too soon to tell how soon they will try to bring up the Justin, as they are still working on the plan.</p>",
